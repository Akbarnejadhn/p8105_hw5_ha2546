## Problem 1
```{r import,replace_NA}

head(iris, 5)

set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

_iris_ is a dataset that contains `r nrow(iris)` observations of `r n_distinct(pull(iris, Species))` different flower species: `r unique(pull(iris, Species))`. It stores information in `r ncol(iris)` variables about flowers: species, sepal length and width, and petal length and width.
First, I chose a sample of 20 from these 150 obserations, and eplaced them with NA. I also converted the species factor variable to numeric. 

```{r fill_NA}


replace_NA_fnc = function(vect){
  
  if(!is.character(vect) & !is.numeric(vect)){
    stop("This function only works on numeric and character vectors")
  } else if(is.character(vect)){
    replace_na(vect, "virginica")
  } else if (is.numeric(vect)) {
    replace_na(vect, mean(vect, na.rm = TRUE))
  }
  
}


iris_output = map(iris_with_missing, replace_NA_fnc) %>%  as_tibble() 
```

## Problem 2
This problem focuses on control and experimental files for 10 subjects, each contain longitudinal data over a 8-week period.

First, we want to import these files' information in a data frame.
```{r tibble_data}

long_data = tibble (
  file_names = list.files(path = "data")
) %>% 
  mutate(
  ourput = map(.x = file_names, ~read_csv(str_c("data/", .x)))
  ) %>% 
  unnest()
```

```{r tidy_data}

long_data_tidy = long_data %>% 
  separate(file_names, c("arm", "case_ID")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "value",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  ) %>% 
  rename(group = arm) %>%
  mutate(
    group = factor(group, levels = c("con", "exp"), labels = c("control", "experimental")),
    week = factor(week, ordered = TRUE),
    case_ID = factor(case_ID)
  )
```

```{r spaghetti_plot}

  ggplot(data = long_data_tidy, aes(x = week, y = value, color = group)) +
  geom_point(data = subset(long_data_tidy, group %in% c("control","experimental"))) +
  geom_line(data=subset(long_data_tidy, group == "control"), aes(group=case_ID, color = group)) +
  geom_line(data=subset(long_data_tidy, group == "experimental"), aes(group=case_ID, color = group)) +
  labs(
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observed Value",
    color = "Group",
    title = "Observed Values over Weeks in Control vs. Experimental Groups"
  ) +
  theme_classic()
```

As it can be observed in the spaghetti plot, in the cotrol group, the observed value of each individual goes up and down but the trend is not overallt increasing or decreasing. However, in the experimental group the overall change in subjects show a general upgrowing trend. Additionally, the total average of experimental group has been higher than control group through weeks and this difference gets greater as we proceed through weeks.
