## Problem 1

``` r
head(iris, 5)
```

    ##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
    ## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
    ## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
    ## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
    ## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
    ## 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

*iris* is a dataset that contains 150 observations of 3 different flower
species: setosa, versicolor, virginica. It stores information in 5
variables about flowers: species, sepal length and width, and petal
length and width. First, I chose a sample of 20 from these 150
obserations, and eplaced them with NA. I also converted the species
factor variable to numeric.

``` r
replace_NA_fnc = function(vect){
  
  if(!is.character(vect) & !is.numeric(vect)){
    stop("This function only works on numeric and character vectors")
  } else if(is.character(vect)){
    replace_na(vect, "virginica")
  } else if (is.numeric(vect)) {
    replace_na(vect, mean(vect, na.rm = TRUE))
  }
  
}


iris_output = map(iris_with_missing, replace_NA_fnc) %>%  as_tibble() 
```

## Problem 2

This problem focuses on control and experimental files for 10 subjects,
each contain longitudinal data over a 8-week period.

First, we want to import these filesâ€™ information in a data frame.

``` r
long_data = tibble(
    file_names = list.files(path = "./data")
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    value = map(.x = file_names, ~read_csv(str_c("./data/", .x)))
  ) %>% 
  unnest()
```
